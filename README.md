This crate implementats traits from [embedded-hal] (https://crates.io/crates/embedded-hal) for the Atmel SAMEX7X architechture.

It is still in the early stages of development, and is currently geared to run on an atsme70q21 cpu. But contributions are welcome.

# OpenOCD

The openocd configuration provided works for my board which is not an off the shelf board. So don't expected to just work for your platform.
